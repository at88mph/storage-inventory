* NodePersistenceImpl: review for necessary transactions and locks

* NodePersistenceImpl: reconcile with NodePersistence API and assign responsibilities
- property update checking
- permission checking
- link node resolution

* files endpoint:
- if coexist with minoc: generate pre-auth  URL to it and redirect
- if coexist with raven: need raven ProtocolsGenerator

* transfer negotiation: 
- review cadc-vos-server and cavern implementations
- probably a complete TransferRunner; maybe separate sync and async runners
- if co-exist with minoc: generate pre-auth  URL to it
- if co-exist with raven: need raven ProtocolsGenerator
- figure out if/how vault can have it's own uws tables in db or share with inventory (luskan)

* pre-auth URL keys -- what to support? recommend?
- vault has it's own key pair && minoc(s) have multiple pub keys?
- vault and raven share private key?
